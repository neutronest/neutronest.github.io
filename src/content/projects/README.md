## Notes

- `README.md` will be ignored by the content loader
- To modify the schema, see the `projects` collection in [src/content.config.ts](../../src/content.config.ts)
- Projects are sorted by `selected` (true > false) `toDate` (descending), then `fromDate` (descending), then `title` (ascending)
- Project cards show `description` if available, otherwise truncated content with a "read more" link
- External links use the LinkExternal component and include hover effects
- The entire project card is clickable and navigates to the project detail page
- EITHER avoid using values that has colon `:` or `[]` OR wrap it in quotes `'` or double-quotes `"`. Otherwise Zod validation would fail.
