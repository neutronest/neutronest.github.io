Astro Scholar 2.1.0 turns the site behind my portfolio into a reusable
open-source theme for **academic profiles**, _research blogs_, projects, and
publications. What began as a personal site is now a starter that other
researchers can install, understand, and make their own.[^portable]

## What ships in 2.1

The release brings the portfolio and the writing system together instead of
treating the blog as an afterthought:

| Surface              | What it is designed to show                             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Profile and timeline | Research interests, experience, teaching, and updates   |
| Projects             | Methods, artifacts, collaborators, code, and outcomes   |
| Publications         | BibTeX-backed papers with abstracts and resource links  |
| Research blog        | Long-form arguments, working notes, and connected ideas |
| Uses page            | The tools and practices behind the work                 |

The interface uses native CSS, very little client-side JavaScript, typed content
collections, and a responsive light/dark theme. Publications, projects, tags,
stages, RSS, sitemap, social images, and author profiles are included.

- [x] Reusable installation and customization guides
- [x] Desktop previews for the Astro theme directory
- [x] Light and dark blog previews
- [x] Automated formatting, linting, Markdown tests, type checks, and builds
- [ ] Your own research and writing

## Technical writing stays readable

Research writing moves between prose, evidence, equations, code, and
qualifications. Astro Scholar keeps those forms in ordinary Markdown instead of
requiring a custom component for each one.

For example, Bayes' rule can sit inline,
$p(\theta \mid D) \propto p(D \mid \theta)p(\theta)$, or expand into a display:

$$
p(\theta \mid D)
= \frac{p(D \mid \theta)\,p(\theta)}
       {\int p(D \mid \theta)\,p(\theta)\,d\theta}
$$

The configured Sätteri pipeline renders the expression as semantic MathML with
Temml. It also supports syntax-highlighted code:

```ts
const release = {
  version: "2.1.0",
  output: "static",
  writing: ["math", "figures", "code", "sidenotes", "wikilinks"],
} as const
```

> A research site should make the path from question to evidence easy to
> inspect—not bury it beneath the machinery of the site.

## A connected research record

Wikilinks connect the release to [[/projects|project notes]],
[[/publications|formal publications]], and [[/now|short updates]]. Ordinary
[Markdown links](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/) work
alongside them, so the source remains portable.

Callouts can begin collapsed when implementation detail should remain available
without interrupting the main argument.

files. Run the full validation suite after updating dependencies.

Footnotes become margin sidenotes on wide screens and compact disclosures on
narrow ones.[^sidenotes] Figures remain local to the post, with descriptive alt
text and Astro image optimization.

## Built for continued maintenance

Version 2.1 also tightens the less visible parts of the theme: the Astro-native
installation path, current integration guidance, agent-facing project context,
Markdown plugin tests, and small architecture checks that protect shared CSS
patterns.

The result is not a frozen personal-site export. It is a foundation intended to
be forked, adapted, and kept current—whether the next entry is a paper summary,
a tutorial, a lab note, or a reflection that begins with a ~~perfect result~~
better question.

[^portable]: Plain Markdown is easy to search, version, migrate, and reuse outside this theme.

[^sidenotes]: Sidenotes keep citations and qualifications near the claim they support while preserving an accessible reading order.
