Astro Scholar is an [Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/why-astro/)
theme for academic personal sites, research blogs, projects, publications, and
now pages. It is a static-first, Markdown-first starter with generic
demonstration content that researchers can replace with their own work.

## Getting Started

Have Node.js `>=22.12.0` and pnpm installed. Create a site directly from the
GitHub starter:

```bash
pnpm create astro@latest --template mychiffonn/astro-scholar
```

Astro's wizard asks for the destination, installs dependencies, and can
initialize Git. See Astro's official
[install and starter-template guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/install-and-setup/#use-a-theme-or-starter-template)
for branch and repository URL options.

Then:

1. Start the development server with `pnpm dev`.
2. Visit <http://localhost:4321>.
3. Follow [docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md) to configure the starter.
4. Personalize content and design with
   [docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md](docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md).

To contribute to the theme itself, clone this repository and run
`corepack enable && pnpm install`.

## Astro and AI-assisted development

Astro's [Build with AI guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/build-with-ai/)
explains how to give coding agents current Astro documentation instead of
relying on potentially stale framework knowledge. This repository also includes
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) with the theme's installation, customization,
development, validation, and publishing conventions.

For supported adapters and integrations, use Astro's setup command:

```bash
pnpm astro add <integration>
```

The command installs the package and updates `astro.config.ts`. Read the
[Astro integrations guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations/)
and the selected integration's documentation first; the theme does not require
a UI framework or server adapter for its default static build.

## Built With

This theme is built on enscribe's

digital garden and al-folio.

## Development
