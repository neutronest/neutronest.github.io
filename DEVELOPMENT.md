# Development

Astro Scholar is based on Astro Erudite v2 and keeps the same core direction:
ship a fast, owned, Markdown-first static site with minimal client JavaScript and
plain CSS that is easy to inspect.

## Principles

- Prefer native Astro, HTML, and CSS before adding framework islands.
- Keep dependencies light. A small local component is often better than a UI
  dependency for one widget.
- Own theme primitives: colors, spacing, typography, shape, motion, and icons are
  local tokens or local files.
- Keep content schema-first. Validate author, project, blog, publication, and
  profile data with Zod instead of allowing loosely shaped content.
- Keep Markdown portable. Prefer `.md`, Sätteri plugins, directives, callouts,
  math, and code transforms over MDX-only content.
- Keep pages dense but readable. This is an academic/research site, not a
  marketing landing page.
- Preserve static output. Avoid client-side state unless the interaction clearly
  needs it.

The Erudite v2 article emphasizes measurable reductions in JavaScript, CSS,
build time, dependencies, and main-thread work; removal of Tailwind, React UI
dependencies, and MDX by default; native CSS tokens; local SVG ownership; and a
Sätteri Markdown pipeline for callouts, links, headings, math, and code. Use
those as the baseline when deciding whether a feature belongs in the theme.

## Project map

- `astro.config.ts`: Astro, sitemap, image, server, and Markdown processor
  configuration.
- `src/site.config.ts`: user-facing site, profile, navigation, publication, and
  footer config.
- `src/content.config.ts`: content collection loaders and schemas.
- `src/schemas.ts`: reusable config and content schema definitions.
- `src/icon.config.ts`: semantic icons, profile icons, project link icons, and
  publication link icons.
- `src/pages/`: routes.
- `src/layouts/`: shared page shells.
- `src/components/`: UI components grouped by domain.
- `src/lib/`: content processing and feature logic.
- `src/styles/`: global CSS tokens and shared styling.
- `src/content/`: user-editable content.
- `public/`: static assets served from `/`.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
pnpm sync
pnpm format
pnpm format:check
pnpm lint
pnpm lint:styles
pnpm test:markdown
pnpm astro check
pnpm build
pnpm preview
pnpm clean
```

Use `pnpm routine` for the standard pre-PR local pass.

## Development loop

1. Read the nearest config and schema before editing behavior.
2. Make the smallest content/schema/component change that satisfies the task.
3. Run the narrowest useful check first.
4. Run `pnpm routine` and `pnpm build` before a pull request.
5. For visual changes, start `pnpm dev` and capture desktop and mobile
   screenshots of affected pages.

## Content rules

- Blog files are Markdown collected from `src/content/blog`.
- Blog subposts use a folder with `index.md` plus ordered child posts.
- Project files are Markdown collected from `src/content/projects`, excluding
  `README.md`.
- People are defined in `src/content/people.toml`.
- Experience is defined in `src/content/experience.json`.
- Publications are loaded from BibTeX at `src/content/publications/main.bib`.

Do not introduce MDX unless the feature genuinely needs component islands inside
content. If MDX is needed, document the reason and update install/customization
docs.

## CSS rules

- Use existing tokens from `src/styles/color.css`, `layout.css`,
  `typography.css`, and `shape.css`.
- Prefer component-scoped CSS in `.astro` files for one component's layout.
- Put shared reusable styling in `src/styles/`.
- Avoid Tailwind and utility-class systems unless the project direction changes.
- Check light and dark modes for all color changes.

## Icon rules

- Prefer semantic icon names from `src/icon.config.ts` in app components.
- Use local SVGs in `src/assets/icons/` for brand/tool icons that are part of the
  theme.
- Add Iconify sets only when they replace many local one-off assets or unlock a
  coherent icon family.

## Theme publishing checklist

Minimum local project pieces:

- `README.md` with demo image, features, install, customization, and deploy
  links.
- `docs/INSTALL.md` and `docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md`.
- `DEVELOPMENT.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- `LICENSE`.
- Useful package metadata: `description`, `keywords`, `license`, `repository`,
  `bugs`, and `homepage`.
- GitHub Actions CI.
- GitHub issue and pull request templates.
- One to four 1600×900 preview screenshots under `docs/assets/previews/`.

Minimum GitHub settings:

- Mark the repository as a template.
- Add topics: `astro`, `astro-theme`, `astro-template`, `academic`, `blog`,
  `portfolio`, `publications`, `research`.
- Enable Issues.
- Protect `main` with CI required before merge.
- Add a deployed demo URL in the repository sidebar.

Recommended repository split:

- Template repo: clean sample content and docs.
- Demo repo: deployed fresh copy that proves the template works without personal
  private content.

Astro theme directory submission:

1. Sign in to the [Astro developer portal](https://portal.astro.build/themes/submit)
   with GitHub.
2. Submit the theme name, short description, full description, repository URL,
   live demo URL, pricing (`Free`), categories (`Portfolio` and `Blog`), and
   technology (`TypeScript`).
3. Upload `docs/assets/previews/home.png` as the primary 16:9 image, then add up
   to three gallery images: `projects.png`, `publications.png`, and `uses.png`.
4. Confirm that the public repository and live demo work without authentication
   before submitting for approval. Publish at least one non-draft demo post so
   the `Blog` category is represented in the live demo.

The Astro catalog renders cards at a 16:9 ratio and supports a primary image plus
additional gallery images. Re-capture the previews after material visual
changes; do not submit the tall full-page README captures.
